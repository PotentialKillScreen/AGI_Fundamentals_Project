# Overview
I participated in the 2021 AGI Safety Fundamentals programme held by Effective Altruism Cambridge.
At the end of the course we were encouraged to make a small project.
My idea was to do Reinforcement Learning with Pytorch as I wanted more experience both with RL and with the Pytorch library specifically.

The project includes:
- A [PowerPoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1666xO5OH-PjDDcnBlRzReApVJi4zv7qaV6P5rgstjqY/edit?usp=sharing) explaining the project and the results.
- The code used in the project. (The code is heavily based on https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch?tab=MIT-1-ov-file but with some minor changes)
- A spreadsheet with raw notes from the experiments used to produce the graphs. This is not cleaned up but is included for transparency.

The results of the project were that I discovered the reward function used was more complicated than necessary.
The inductive biases were such that punishing stalling was not necessary.
