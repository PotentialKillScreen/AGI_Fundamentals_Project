# Overview
I participated in the 2021 AGI Safety Fundamentals programme held by Effective Altruism Cambridge.
To finish of the course we were encouraged to make a small project.
My idea was to do Reinforcement Learning with Pytorch as I wanted more experience both with RL and with the Pytorch library specifically.

The project includes a powerpoint explaining the project and the results.
Also included is the code used.
The code is heavily based on https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch?tab=MIT-1-ov-file but with some minor changes.

The results of the project was that I discovered the reward function used was more complicated than necessary.
The inductive biases were such that punishing stalling was not necessary.
